                <p> I am currently a first year student
                     at Indian Hills Community College. 
                     She has found her major which is Interactive 
                     Media Technology. I found my major by my
                     Dad, "My dad is an adjunct professor at the 
                     college. He mentioned the program to me and it 
                     sounded perfect for me. At this time I was in
                      Yearbook in High School. So I had to take 
                      pictures, interview my peers, write captions
                       about the pictures. I also have a love for 
                       social media and creating things." 
                       - Kaelan Knudtson I have always been a 
                       creative person I grew up dancing since the 
                       age of 5. I have learned so much from it. I 
                       definitely see myself, joining a the staff of 
                       a dance competition and run their social media accounts. </p>
